## cli ##
$curr
	
	listf
		-> listf files...
		-> ln527 grab_files. instead of returning null,
			 let it go through the entire cond stmt, 
				returning just itself. l_arg should be able
				to print out all the right info
				. verify dirs func also checks if its a file
					(checks an arg with no dash.)

	tokenizer..
		ln118. end_p.. line[size-1] instead of og [size-2]?
		could be because file names have extensions..not sure

	fref <
		text file must have regexp on one line, then files
		on the next
	e fref "hi" < test_fref.txt

	cli
		$> cat < test_calc.txt
	

$ notes
 - for cd: check "/" and adjust.
	-> ex: "cd Documents/"
 - regex has a \n at the end of it. (fgets)
 x listf. for "list dir..." or "list -o dirs...",
		cant figure out how to list them alphabetically.
		it seems that "files" in local function is
		persistent.
 e limit number of characters for options
 e throw error if none of -lmac is entered
 e throw error if too much flags
 - ./listf -l test3...
		-> chdir(argv[v])
				might have to stabalize this?
 - listf
  -> filter . and ..?
 -> for option flags, im passing argv and starting
		loops at 1.
